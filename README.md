# Blockchain research

This is a living repository of research for the blockchain capabilities for the Verida network.

## Protocol Projects

1. [DID registry](https://github.com/verida/did-server) - A Verida DID method
2. [DID linkages](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-research/issues/11) - Linking a Verida account to public blockchain addresses
3. VDA primary blockchain - Research to determine the best blockchain for Verida's smart contracts
4. VDA token contract - ERC20 implementation of Verida token on Ethereum mainnet
5. VDA token release - Ethereum mainnet smart contract for releasing VRD tokens to team, investors etc.
6. VDA token bridge - Project for bridging the VRD token between Ethereum mainnet and the chosen VRD primary blockchain
7. Interactions registry - Records network interacactions and facilitates micro-payments between accounts
8. Name registry - Creating a human readable name (ie: chris.verida) as an alias to Verida account (ENS equivalent for Verida DID's)
9. Application registry - Applications register their application name to claim ownership and increase trust across dApps on the network
10. Trust registry - A public register of verifiable credentials published by Verida accounts
11. Trusted ACL - Provide decentralized access control to private data between multiple parties
12. Trust hierarchy - A public hierarchy of organizations that trust each other, inspired by certificate authorities and OAuth consent permissions
13. Token rewards - Provide token rewards to users based on proof of a performing a particular action
14. [Private data bridge](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-research/blob/main/private-data-bridge/overview.md)
14. Third party payments - Facilitate guaranteed third party payments for data

## Research Priorities - Q4 2021

1. DID registry (API complete)
2. DID linkages (PoC underway)
3. VDA primary blockchain (priority as it's the foundation for all blockchain development)
4. Private data bridge (priority as it may impact the Verida protocol signature scheme)
