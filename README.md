# Blockchain research

This is a living repository of research for the blockchain capabilities for the Verida network.

## Protocol Projects

1. **[DID registry](https://github.com/verida/did-server)** - A Verida DID method
2. **[DID linkages](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-research/issues/11)** - Linking a Verida account to public blockchain addresses
3. **[VDA primary blockchain](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-research/blob/main/primary-blockchain/overview.md)** - Research to determine the best blockchain for Verida's smart contracts
4. **VDA token contract** - ERC20 implementation of Verida token on Ethereum mainnet
5. **VDA token release** - Ethereum mainnet smart contract for releasing VRD tokens to team, investors etc.
6. **VDA token bridge** - Project for bridging the VRD token between Ethereum mainnet and the chosen VRD primary blockchain
7. **Interactions registry** - Records network interacactions and facilitates micro-payments between accounts
8. **Name registry** - Creating a human readable name (ie: chris.verida) as an alias to Verida account (ENS equivalent for Verida DID's)
9. **Application registry** - Applications register their application name to claim ownership and increase trust across dApps on the network
10. **Service registry** - Registry of services available on the Verida network (ie; storage nodes, messaging nodes etc.)
11. **Trust registry** - A public register of verifiable credentials published by Verida accounts
12. **Trusted ACL (Permission NFTs)** - Provide decentralized access control to private data between multiple parties
13. **Trust hierarchy** - A public hierarchy of organizations that trust each other, inspired by certificate authorities and OAuth consent permissions
14. **Token rewards** - Provide token rewards to users based on proof of a performing a particular action
15. **[Private data bridge](https://github.com/verida/blockchain-research/blob/main/private-data-bridge/overview.md)** - Enable off-chain private data to be used on-chain
16. **Third party payments** - Facilitate guaranteed third party payments for data
17. **NFT data** - Connect off chain data to an NFT for a variety of use cases

## Q4 2021

1. DID registry (API complete)
2. DID linkages (PoC underway)
3. VDA primary blockchain (priority as it's the foundation for all blockchain development)
4. Private data bridge (priority as it may impact the Verida protocol signature scheme)

## Q1 2022

1. Private data bridge (Nona PoC complete)
2. Decentralized DID Registry (Alex has completed a PoC to migrate `ethr-did-registry` to `vda-did-registry` and supporting libraries)
3. VDA primary blockchain (Still under research, currently using Polygon and trying to optimise transaction times)
4. VDA token contract (Alex has completed)
5. Interactions registry (Research is ongoing)
6. VDA token bridge (Pending primary blockchain selection decision)
7. Gasless transactions (PoC in progress)
8. Sponsored transactions (PoC in progress)

## Q2 2022

1. Decentralized DID Registry (Deploy to testnet)
2. VDA token contract (Deploy to testnet)
3. VDA primary blockchain (Make final decisions)
4. Interactions registry (Phase 1 implement and depoy to testnet)
5. Service registry (Implement and deploy to testnet)
6. Name registry (Deploy to testnet)
7. DID linkages (PoC)
8. Gasless transactions (Deploy to testnet)
9. Sponsored transactions (Deploy to testnet)
